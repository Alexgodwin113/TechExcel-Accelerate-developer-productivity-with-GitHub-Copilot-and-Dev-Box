# TechExcel: Accelerate developer productivity with GitHub Copilot and Dev Box

This lab teaches you how to take advantage of Microsoft Dev Boxes, creating a consistent virtual machine image for developers on a team. You will also make use of a variety of GitHub features for code management, project management, and Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) via GitHub Actions workflows. You will use GitHub Copilot to simplify a variety of development tasks, and also see how GitHub Advanced Security can make it easier to secure a GitHub repository.

## Exercises

This lab has exercises on:

* Set up the development environment
* Start working in GitHub
* Improve and deploy your application
* Make things secured
* Fix a performance issue using GitHub Copilot

The lab is available as GitHub pages [here](https://microsoft.github.io/TechExcel-Accelerate-developer-productivity-with-GitHub-Copilot-and-Dev-Box)

## Prerequisites

For running this lab you will need:

* An AAD tenant where you are a global admin. and an Azure subscription in that same tenant.
* M365 E5 licenses (or a trial for these licenses configured) in that same tenant.

**[MCAPS non-prod subscriptions](https://dev.azure.com/OneCommercial/NoCode/_wiki/wikis/NoCode.wiki/12/Hybrid-Subscription) are the most convenient way for you to meet all these prerequisites**, and the lab activities assume that you have configured an external subscription via [https://aka.ms/MCAPSNewAzureSub](https://aka.ms/MCAPSNewAzureSub). Note that this must be an **external** MCAPS subscription and not a hybrid subscription.

{: .note }
> If you requested an external MCAPS subscription prior to April of 2024, you might have an obsolete MCAPS subscription. In that case, you will need to delete the subscription, delete the tenant, and re-request the external MCAPS subscription in the new system **before** beginning these labs. The link above will allow you to request a subscription in the new system. Obsolete external MCAPS subscriptions will be eliminated in September of 2024.
